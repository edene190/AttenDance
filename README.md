# AttenDance

You can view this project at www.myattendance.online/attendance

Use an NFC tag (these have been put in student IDs for the past 5 years at least) on a mobile device with NFC tag reading capabilities. If you can do tap and pay, you can do NFC.

After you record attendance on the website, you can go to www.myattendance.online/attendanceTable.php to see your attendance added to the database.
